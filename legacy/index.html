      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Math Library was built on the conviction that mathematical knowledge should be preserved, organized, and made accessible in a timeless way—independent of trends, technologies, or commercial pressures. Our approach draws from the spirit of early universities, great libraries, and open knowledge movements.
      </p>
    </section>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>On Knowledge Preservation</h3>
        <p>
          Mathematics is humanity's most universal language. The theorems and principles discovered centuries ago remain true and relevant today. We believe mathematical knowledge deserves to be preserved with the same care given to cultural heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much educational content today is ephemeral—tied to platforms, algorithms, or commercial interests that change. We're building Math Library to last. Our content will remain accessible, readable, and relevant decades from now.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>On Clarity Over Novelty</h3>
        <p>
          There's a temptation in educational technology to add features, animations, and complexity. We resist this. Our design philosophy is purposefully minimal: no distracting animations, no algorithmic feeds, no unnecessary features. Just clear explanations and knowledge organized for understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best educational tools get out of the way and let the content speak. Our design reflects this belief.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>On Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          Mathematical education shouldn't be gated by paywalls, paywalls, proprietary platforms, or geographic barriers. Math Library is free, open, and built to be accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe the best way to serve education is to remove barriers, not create them.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>On Community</h3>
        <p>
          The greatest educational resources are built by communities. Wikipedia didn't start as a company—it started as a vision. We believe the same is true for mathematics education. Math Library invites mathematicians, teachers, and learners to contribute, review, and improve the resource together.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Historical Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision draws from several traditions and models of knowledge preservation and education:
      </p>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>The Ancient University</h3>
        <p>
          The early universities of Europe (Oxford, Cambridge, Bologna) organized knowledge with remarkable clarity. Mathematics and natural philosophy were central. These institutions preserved and built upon knowledge from ancient Greek, Persian, and Islamic scholarship. They created lasting frameworks for understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We admire their approach: organizing knowledge hierarchically, building from foundations to advanced topics, welcoming scholars from everywhere.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>The Public Library</h3>
        <p>
          Public libraries embody a beautiful principle: that knowledge is a public good. Librarians organize, preserve, and make information accessible to everyone regardless of resources. The internet age didn't eliminate this need—it amplified it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Math Library aspires to be a library for mathematics on the internet: organized, freely accessible, and dedicated to long-term preservation.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>The Curriculum</h3>
        <p>
          Before the internet, curricula were carefully designed learning paths that progressed logically from foundations to advanced topics. A student following the curriculum built deep understanding. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While self-directed learning is powerful, we believe structured learning paths remain valuable. Our courses follow curricular principles: starting with foundations, progressing logically, connecting to broader contexts.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>The Textbook</h3>
        <p>
          Great textbooks have remained relevant for decades or even centuries. Euclid's Elements, Newton's Principia, Gauss's works—these are still read because they combine rigor with clarity. They're permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We write for permanence. Our goal is that the content on Math Library could be read and valued in 2050, 2075, or beyond.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>The Repository</h3>
        <p>
          Open-access repositories like arXiv revolutionized scientific communication by making preprints freely available. We're inspired by this model: building an open repository of mathematical knowledge, curated and organized for learning.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Design Choices Reflecting Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Every design decision reflects our values. Here's why we've made certain choices:
      </p>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Serif Typography</h3>
        <p>
          We use serif fonts (Georgia, Garamond) because they evoke the printed books and academic publishing traditions we admire. Serif typefaces are also highly readable for long-form content. They signal substance.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Neutral Colors</h3>
        <p>
          We avoid bright, trendy colors. Instead, we use neutral palettes (beige, cream, navy, dark green) that recall academic and institutional design. These colors evoke libraries, universities, and timeless design that won't feel dated in a few years.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Minimal Animation</h3>
        <p>
          We deliberately avoid animations, transitions, and interactive flourishes. These can be distracting and add complexity. We want users to focus on the content, not the interface.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Semantic HTML & Web Standards</h3>
        <p>
          We build with semantic HTML that will remain interpretable and usable for decades. We avoid frameworks and dependencies that will become obsolete. This ensures Math Library can be preserved and accessed in the future.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Content-First Design</h3>
        <p>
          The layout prioritizes content. Large, readable text. Ample whitespace. Clear hierarchy. No ads, no tracking, no algorithmic feeds. The content is the focus.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Math Library is built for the long term. Here's our vision for where this project is heading:
      </p>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Comprehensive Coverage</h3>
        <p>
          We're starting with foundational mathematics (algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics). Over time, we'll expand to more advanced topics: linear algebra, discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, topology, analysis, differential equations, and more. The goal is a comprehensive resource covering mathematics education from high school through graduate level.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Multimedia Resources</h3>
        <p>
          While we keep the design minimal, we want to add complementary resources: diagrams, visualizations, worked examples, video explanations, and problem sets. These will enhance learning while maintaining our principle of clarity.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Community Growth</h3>
        <p>
          We're building infrastructure for a growing community of mathematicians, educators, and learners. We want Math Library to become a place where people learn, contribute, discuss, and collaborate.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Multiple Languages</h3>
        <p>
          Mathematical knowledge is universal. Eventually, we want to translate Math Library into multiple languages, making it accessible to learners worldwide.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <h3>Permanence & Preservation</h3>
        <p>
          We're exploring ways to ensure Math Library remains accessible in the future: partnerships with archival organizations, redundant hosting, open-source code that can be maintained by others. We want this to outlast any single organization.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        Math Library is not a solo project. It's an invitation to mathematicians, educators, and learners to build something permanent together. If you share our vision—that mathematical knowledge deserves preservation, clarity, and accessibility—we invite you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/learn/">Learn</a> from our resources</li>
        <li><a href="/discuss/">Discuss</a> mathematics and education with our community</li>
        <li><a href="/contribute/">Contribute</a> your own content, expertise, and ideas</li>
        <li>Help us reach others and grow the community</li>
        <li>Imagine with us what mathematics education could be</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
      <p>
        In 1440, Gutenberg's printing press made books reproducible and knowledge shareable at scale. In 1971, Project Gutenberg began digitizing books to preserve them for future generations. In 1995, Wikipedia began organizing human knowledge collaboratively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Math Library is part of this lineage. We're using tools available to us—the internet, collaboration, open-source principles—to preserve and organize mathematical knowledge. We're building a resource that we hope will be useful today and remain relevant for generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's our legacy. That's our philosophy. That's our hope.
